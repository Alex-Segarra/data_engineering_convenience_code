### AWS Work

1. I have previously used PuTTY terminals to connect to and perform work within AWS systems such as S3, Sagemaker, EC2, and Redshift.
2. Unfortunately, quite a bit of my work was covered under IP agreements.  These are the few work samples that were generalizeable enough to be called "my own."
3. **Caveat:** I had to use base level python 2.7 for all my examples, so pardon the lack of sophistication.
